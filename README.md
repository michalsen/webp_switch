WebP Switch

Configuring Wordpress for Webp images since 1975.

This is specifically for Wordpress on Pantheon where there is no .htaccess and no access to the nginx config.

So, use Webp Express to convert all the images to webp, and don't mingle.
Turn off Webp Express and turn this one on, and it'll probably work.


Maybe.
